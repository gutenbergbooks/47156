<p>Again he that steals flesh, steals once, and gives over; yes,
and often pays for it: the other steals every day, without
satisfaction. To conclude, Bread-stealing is the more capital
crime: for what he steals he puts it in at the head: he that
steals flesh (as the Dutch Author says) puts it in at the foot
(the lower member.) Will you go as you are now, Miller?</p>

<h4><i>Sc&aelig;na Secunda.</i></h4>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter two Gentlewomen.</i>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. But yfaith dost thou think my Lady was never in love?</p>

<p>2. I rather think she was ever in love: in perfect charity.
I mean, with all the world.</p>

<p>[1]. A most Christian answer I promise you: but I mean
in Love with a man.</p>

<p>2. With a man? what else? would'st have her in love with a beast?</p>

<p>1. You are somewhat quick: but if she were, it were no
President: did you never read of <i>Europa</i>, the fair, that leapt
A bull, that leapt the Sea, that swoom to land, and then leapt her?</p>

<p>2. Oh heavens, a bull?</p>

<p>1. Yes, a white bull.</p>

<p>2. Lord, how could she sit him? where did she hold?</p>

<p>1. Why, by the horn, since which time, no woman (almost) is
Contented, till she have a horn of her own, to hold by.</p>

<p>2. Thou art very knavish.</p>

<p>1. And thou very foolish: but sirah, why dost not thou marry?</p>

<p>2. Because I would be no mans looking-glase?</p>

<p>1. As how?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>2. As thus, there is no Wife, if she be good, and true,
will honor, and obey, but must reflect the true countenance
of her husband upon him; if he look sad upon her she must
not look merrily upon him: if he look merrily, she must not
sorrowfully, else she is a false glass, and fit for nothing but
breaking: his anger [must] be her discontent; his pleasure,
her delight: if he weep, she must cry: if he laugh, she must
show her teeth: if he be sick, she must not be in health; if he
eat Cawdles, she must eat pottage, she must have no proper
passion of her own; and is not this a tyranny?</p>

<p>1. Yes, yfaith, Marriage may well be called a yoak;
Wives then are but like superficial lines in Geometry, that
have no proper motion of their own, but as their bodies their
husbands move, yet I know some Wives, that are never freely
merry, nor truly pleased, but when they are farthest off their
husbands.</p>

<p>2. That's because the Moon governs 'em which hath most
light and shines brightest, the more remote it is from the Sun;
and contrary is more sullen, dim, and showes least splendor,
when it is neerest.</p>

<p>1. But if I were to marry I would marry a fair effeminate
fool.</p>

<p>2. Why?</p>

<p>1. Because I would lead the blind whither I list.</p>

<p>2. And I the wisest man I could get for money, because I
had rather follow the cleer-sighted: bless me from a husband
That sales by his Wives compass!</p>

<p>1. Why?</p>

<p>2. Why 'tis ten to one but she breaks his head in her
youth, and when she is old shee'l never leave till she has
broke his back too&mdash;</p>

<h3><i>Actus Secundus. Sc&aelig;na Prima.</i></h3>


<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> Pachieco, <i>and</i> Lazarillo.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Pac.</i> <span class="fauxdc">B</span>Oy: [my] Cloak, and Rapier; it fits not a Gentleman
of my rank, to walk the streets in <i>Querpo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Nay, you are a very rank Gent. Signior, I am very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
hungry, they tell me in <i>Sevil</i> here, I look like an Eel, with a
mans head: and your neighbor the Smith here hard by, would
have borrowed me th' other day, to have fish'd with me, because
he had lost his Angle-rod.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Oh happy thou <i>Lazarillo</i> (being the cause of other
mens wits) as in thine own: live lean, and witty still: oppress
not thy stomach too much: gross feeders, great sleepers[: great
sleepers,] fat bodies; fat bodies, lean brains: No <i>Lazarillo</i>, I
will make thee immortal, change thy Humanity into Deity,
for I will teach thee to live upon nothing.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Faith Signior, I am immortal then already, or very
near it, for I do live upon little or nothing: belike that's the
reason the Poets are said to be immortal, for some of them live
upon their wits, which is indeed as good as little or nothing:
But good Master, let me be mortal still, and let's go to supper.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Be abstinent; shew not the corruption of thy generation:
he that feeds, shall die, therefore, he that feeds not shall
live.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> I; but how long shall he live? there's the question.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> As long as he can without feeding: did'st thou read
of the miraculous Maid in <i>Flanders</i>?</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> No, nor of any Maid else; for the miracle of Virgi[n]ity
now-a-days ceases, e'r the Virgin can read Virginity?</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> She that liv'd three years without any other sustenance,
than the smell of a Rose.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> I heard of her <i>Signior</i>, but they say her guts shrunk
all into Lute-strings, and her neather-parts cling'd together like
a Serpents Tail, so that though she continued a woman still
above the girdle, beneath yet she was monster.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> So are most women, believe it.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Nay all women <i>Signior</i>, that can live only upon the
smell of a Rose.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> No part of the History is fabulous.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> I think rather no part of the Fable is Historical: but
for all this, Sir, my rebellious stomach will not let me be immortal:
I will be as immortal, as mortal hunger will suffer:
put me to a certain stint Sir, allow me but a red herring a day.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> <i>O' de dios</i>: wouldst thou be gluttonous in thy delicacies?</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> He that eats nothing but a red herring a day, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
ne'r be broil'd for the devil's rasher: a Pilchard, <i>Signior</i>, a
Surdiny, an Olive, that I may be a Philosopher first, and
immortal after.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Patience <i>Lazarillo</i>; let contemplation be thy food
awhile: I say unto thee, one Pease was a Soldiers Provant a
whole day,
At the destruction of <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p></div>

<p class="directcenter"><i>Enter</i> Metaldi, <i>and</i> Mendoza.
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Laz.</i> I; and it were any where but at the destruction
of a place, I'll be hang'd.</p>

<p><i>Met.</i> <i>Signior Pachieco Alasto</i>, my most ingenious
Cobler of <i>Sevil</i>, the <i>bonos noxios</i> to your Signiorie.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> <i>Signior Metaldi de Forgio</i>, my most famous Smith,
and man of Mettle, I return your courtesie ten fold, and do
humble my Bonnet beneath the Shooe-sole of your congie:
the like to you <i>Signior Mendoza Pediculo de Vermim</i>, my most
exquisite Hose-heeler.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Here's a greeting betwixt a Cobler, a Smith, and a
Botcher: they all belong to the foot, which makes them stand
so much upon their Gentrie.</p>

<p><i>Mend.</i> <i>Signior Lazarillo.</i></p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Ah Signior see: nay, we are all <i>Signiors</i> here in
<i>Spain</i>, from the Jakes-farmer to the Grandee, or <i>Adelantado</i>:
this Botcher looks as if he were Dough-bak'd, a little Butter
now, and I could eat him like an Oaten-cake: his fathers
diet was new Cheese and Onions when he got him: what
a scallion-fac'd rascal 'tis!</p>

<p><i>Met.</i> But why <i>Signior Pachieco</i>, do you stand so much on
the priority, and antiquity of your quality (as you call it) in
comparison of ours?</p>

<p><i>Mend.</i> I; your reason for that.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Why thou Iron-pated Smith: and thou Woollen-witted
Hose-heeler: hear what I will speak indifferently (and
according to antient Writers) of our three professions: and
let the upright <i>Lazarillo</i> be both judge and moderator.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Still am I the most immortally hungry; that may be.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Suppose thou wilt derive thy Pedigree, like some of
the old <i>Heroes</i>, (as <i>Hercules, &AElig;neas, Achilles</i>) lineally from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
gods, making <i>Saturn</i> thy great Grandfather, and <i>Vulcan</i> thy
Father: <i>Vulcan</i> was a god.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> He'll make <i>Vulcan</i> your godfather by and by.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Yet I say, <i>Saturn</i> was a crabbed block-head, and
<i>Vulcan</i> a limping Horn-head, for <i>Venus</i> his wife was a strumpet,
and <i>Mars</i> begot all her Children; therefore however, thy
original must of necessity spring from Bastardie: further, what
can be a more deject spirit in man, than to lay his hands under
every ones horses feet, to do him service, as thou dost? For
thee, I will be brief, thou dost botch, and not mend, thou art
a hider of enormities, <i>viz.</i>, Scabs, chilblains, and kib'd heels:
much prone thou art to Sects, and Heresies, disturbing State,
and Government; for how canst thou be a sound member in the
common-wea[l]th, that art so subject to stit[c]hes in the ankles?
blush, and be silent then, oh ye Mechanicks, compare no more
with the politick Cobler: For Coblers (in old time) have prophesied,

waxed better, and better? have we not the length of every
mans foot? are we not daily menders? yea, and what menders?
not horse-menders.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Nor manners-menders.</p>

<p><i>Pach.</i> But soul-menders: Oh divine Coblers; do we not,
like the wise man, spin out our own threads, (or our wives
for us?) do we not by our sowing the Hide, reap the Beef? are
not we of the Gentle-craft, whilst both you are but Crafts-men;
You will say, you fear neither Iron nor Steel, and what you get
is wrought out of the fire; I must answer you again, though,
all this is but forgery: You may likewise say, a man's a man,
that has but a hose on his head: I must likewise answer, that
man is a botcher, that has a heel'd hose on his head: to conclude,
there can be no comparison with the Cobler, who is all
in all in the Common-wealth, has his politique eye and ends on
every mans steps that walks, and whose course shall be lasting
to the worlds end.</p>

Fleet was gone, and then earn'd your Royal a day by squiring
puncks, and puncklings up and down the City?</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Are not you a <i>Portuguize</i> born, descended o' the
<i>Moors</i>, and came hither into <i>Sevil</i> with your Master, an arrant
Tailor, in your red Bonnet, and your blue Jacket, lousie, though
now your block-head be cover'd with the <i>Spanish</i> block, and
your lashed Shoulders with a Velvet Pee.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Are not you he that have been of thirty callings, yet
ne'r a one lawful? that being a Chandler first, profess'd sincerity,
and would sell no man Mustard to his Beef on the Sabbath, and
yet sold Hypocrisie all your life time?</p>

<p><i>Met.</i> Are not you he, that were since a Surgeon to the

not, Strumpets that rise to your office by being a great Don's
Bawd?</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> That commit men nightly, offenceless, for the gain
of a groat a prisoner, which your Beadle seems to put up, when
you share three pence?</p>

<p><i>Mend.</i> Are not you he that is a kisser of men, in drunkenness,
and a betrayer in sobriety?</p>

<p><i>Alg.</i> <i>Diabolo</i>: they'll rail me into the Gallies again.</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> Yes Signior, thou art even he we speak of all this
while: thou mayst by thy place now, lay us by the heels:
'tis true: but take heed, be wiser, pluck not ruin on thine own
head: for never was there such an Anatomie, as we shall make
thee then: be wise therefore, [Oh] thou child of the night! be
friends, and shake hands, thou art a proper man, if thy beard
were redder: remember thy worshipful function, a Constable;
though thou turn'st day into night, and night into day, what of
that? watch less and pray more:   [gird thy beares skin (<i>viz.</i> thy
Rug-gowne) to thy loyes, take thy staffe in thy hand, and goe
forth at midnight:] Let not thy mittens abate the talons of thy
authority, but gripe theft and whoredom, wheresoever thou
meet'st 'em: bear 'em away like a tempest, and lodge 'em
safely in thine own house:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Would you have whores and thieves lodgd in such a
house?</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> They ever do so: I have found a thief, or a whore
there, when the whole Suburbs could not furnish me.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> But why do they lodge there?</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> That they may be safe and forth-coming: for in the
morning usually, the thief is sent to the Goal, and the whore
prostrates her self to the Justice.</p>

<p><i>Men.</i> Admirable <i>Pachiecho</i>.</p>

<p><i>Met.</i> Thou Cobler of <i>Christendom</i>.</p>

<p><i>Alg.</i> There is no railing with these rogues: I will close
with 'em, till I can cry quittance: why Signiors, and my
honest neighbors, will you impute that as a neglect of my
friends, which is an imperfection in me? I have been Sandblind
from my infancy: to make you amends you shall sup
with me.</p>

<p><i>Laz.</i> Shall we sup with ye, Sir? O' my conscience, they
have wrong'd the Gentleman extreamly.</p>

<p><i>Alg.</i> And after supper, I have a project to employ you
in, shall make you drink and eat merrily this month: I am a
little knavish: why, and doe not I know all you to be knaves?</p>

<p><i>Pac.</i> I grant you, we are all knaves, and will be your
knaves: But oh, while you live, take heed of being a proud
knave.</p>

<p><i>Alg.</i> On then pass: I will bear out my staffe, and my

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>In the following references to the text the lines are numbered from the top of the</i>
<i>page, including titles, acts, stage directions, &amp;c., but not, of course, the</i>
<i>headline or mere 'rules.' Where, as in the lists of Persons Represented,</i>
<i>there are double columns, the right-hand column is numbered after the left.</i></p></div>

<p>It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every turned
letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks of exclamation
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Full-stops have been silently inserted at the ends of speeches
and each fresh speaker has been given the dignity of a fresh line: in the
double-columned folio the speeches are frequently run on. Misprints in the
Quartos and the First Folio are recorded when they appear to be interesting.
A word or two from the printed text is attached to the variants recorded below
in cases where the variant, by itself, would not be sufficiently clear. Altered
punctuation is shown, usually, by printing the old punctuation between the
preceding and following words.</p>

<p><b>A</b> = First folio. <b>B</b> = Second folio.</p>
